Thanks for reporting issues back to Nextcloud W2G2!

Note: This is the **issue tracker of Nextcloud W2G2**, please do NOT use this to get answers to your questions or get help for fixing your installation. This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on NextCloud user forums: https://help.nextcloud.com or, if you use Nextcloud in a large organization, ask NextCloud engineers on https://portal.nextcloud.com. See also  https://nextcloud.com/support for support options.

Nextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of NextCloud volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. NextCloud paid engineers prioritize issues of NextCloud customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.

Guidelines for submitting issues:

* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
    - Go to https://github.com/newroco/W2G2 and type any word in the top search/command bar. You probably see something like "We couldn’t find any repositories matching ..." then click "Issues" in the left navigation.
    - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
    - More info on search syntax within github: https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues
    
* This repository https://github.com/newroco/W2G2/issues is *only* for issues within the Nextcloud W2G2 code.
